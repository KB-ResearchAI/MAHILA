# Differences from Chronological Experiments

## Summary

| Component | Chronological | Random-Stratified |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Dataset split | Time-based | Random stratified |
| Class balance | Implicit | Explicitly preserved |
| Seed | Fixed | Same fixed seed |
| Architectures | Same | Same |
| Training loop | Same | Same |
| Metrics | Same | Same |

## Dataset Splitting
Chronological experiments use time-ordered splits reflecting deployment
conditions. Random-stratified experiments pool all samples and apply stratified
random sampling with a fixed seed.

## Hyperparameters
Hyperparameters may differ across models. (please check the hyperparameters as mentioned in all_models_random_stratified_eye_split_python_notebook.ipynb)

## Unchanged Components
Model architectures, loss functions, optimizer types, training logic, and
evaluation metrics remain unchanged.
